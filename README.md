## :video_game: TIC TAC TOE
You probably already know how to play Tic-Tac-Toe. It's a really simple game, right? That's what most people think. But if you really wrap your brain around it, you'll discover that Tic-Tac-Toe isn't quite as simple as you think!
Tic-Tac -Toe (along with a lot of other games) involves looking ahead and trying to figure out what the person playing against you might do next.
## :eyes: features
It is a classic 2-player game where players take turns marking the spaces with their chosen symbol (either X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. If all the spaces are filled and no one has won, the game ends in a draw.

## :page_facing_up: About

## :pencil2: Planning & Problem Solving
Understand the rules and objectives of the game.

Analyze the game tree: Since tic tac toe has a limited number of possible moves and outcomes, it is possible to create a game tree that shows all the possible positions and their values based on perfect play.

Practice and evaluate: Like any skill, playing tic tac toe requires practice and feedback. Players can play against each other, they can also analyze their past games to identify their strengths and weaknesses, and improve their decision-making, prediction, and adaptation abilities.
